                    alt="Bailey in a scarf" 
                    title="my friend Bailey, wearing a scarf" /></h6>
                <p>This is my friend Bailey. She's a painter. We've been best 
                    friends since we were twelve years old. #soulmates
                </p>
                <p>Oh, and we also live together in a beautiful apartment 
                    in South City.</p>

                <p>This is my friend Mitha. She's going to Harvard Law School. 
                    She's very impressive. I like to brag about her.

                <p>This is my friend Ally. Look at her gecko! Ally takes the best 
                    selfies. One time, my friend Bailey gave Ally a tattoo of a 
                    cactus! It was awesome.

                <p>And then there's these guys: Eve, Pancake, and Chihiro.</p>
                <p>Eve is a grumpy-sweet formerly feral black cat who hates 
                    being photographed. Everyone who meets her falls in love 
                    instantly.</p>
                <p>Pancake is a calico who Bailey adopted when she meant 
                    to go looking for a dog. She has often been described 
                    as "a squishy pile of love."</p>
                <p>Chihiro is my dog. She has a lot of nicknames. One of her 
                    nicknames is Cheerio. She comes to class with me 
                    every week and is very bored. (She says she's 
                    &quot;not into computers.&quot;)</p>
